This document provides a curated collection of system prompts and user-facing preset prompts. These can be used to configure the AI's persona, set constraints, or provide convenient starting points for users.

## 1. System Prompts

System prompts are used to define the AI's personality, capabilities, and limitations for an entire session. They are typically set using the `/ai set-system` command.
